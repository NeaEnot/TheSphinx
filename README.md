Simple password manager.

Two passwords are used for encryption - the password from the storage and the password from the encrypted fields.

When the application is first launched, it will ask you to enter the password for the storage, and then create a storage.dat file in which all data will be stored.

I tried to make it possible to synchronize the encrypted storage via Yandex.Disk, but I haven't succeeded yet. I will be glad to your suggestions)

You can download the application from the [link](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/673jNfoSUraw5g).
